# A Simple Music Player
<p>Project #4 of the Android Basics Nano-Degree</p>

### Short Description

<p>They asked us, students, to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app.</p>
<p>Making it work wasn't mandatory but I saw it as a nice challenge and made it anyway with a ton of research.</p>

## How it works

<p>It's a simple music player made with two activities</p>
<p>It let's you (after you conceed permission):</p>
<p>- list all the audio files inside your external storage (SD Card)</p>
<p>- let's you select any and add those to a small customizable playlist</p>
<p>- play them in something that you can call a music player in any order (not exactly one hundred percent customizable as in other top notch apps but gives you a bit of freedom)</p>
<br>
<p>NOTE#1: Resources used, in case you miss them in the code, can be accessed with a single press at the logo.</p>
<p>NOTE#2: Yes, it has a splash screen when you start it. I like to add it to every single stuff I do when possible.</p>

## Reasons to make it this way

<p>It's a nice challenge with limited knowledge and pushed me to go further in search of more.</p>
<p>Main idea was simply to list audio files in the SD Card and let the user do a single playlist that could be modified when wanted without much effort.</p>
<p>I don't know about others but I find it boring to manage a ton of playlists based on a keyword so I opted to a simplified approach.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that you can do this with a single playlist but it asks for presses that I don't really want to do and changing it all the time means wasted time.</p>
<p>This way I can run the app, select the songs I care that I've in my smartphone, and let them play until I get bored.</p>
<p>Got tired of one of them? No problem, just do a quick edit.</p>
<p>Got tired of the entire selection? Make a new one after doing a reset with the refresh button.</p>
<p>Feels... simple.</p>

<p>NOTE: I don't have the knowledge of someone pro so there is no fancy widget, just that it plays while you do other things or lock the smartphone.</p>
<p>As I said - It's simple. My version of something simple.</p>
